## 2. Announcements & Notifications
- RexZ may send important updates, announcements, or security alerts in a server's **rexz-log channel**.

## 5. Support & Liability

- We reserve the right to remove or modify features at any time without prior notice.
- We are **not responsible** for any disruptions, bans, or server issues caused by misuse of the bot.

## 6. Updates & Changes
